# Prosopagknows Web App

### The Premise:
Ever get really, really confused watching movies? It's not that you can't follow the plot, it's just... there's so many faces! I myself (a proud prosopagnosiac) have a condition that prevents me from recognizing faces, even those of my friends and family. I have plenty of strategies to navigate this, but as an avid movie enjoyer, I found I needed a little extra help to tell apart all the characters. Especially in military movies or Oppnehemir

## How it Works:

First:
- Tell the script what movie you're watching. There's room for error, but try and get the title right.
- The program will give you a numbered list of movies that match your title. Just return the number!
- For example:
  - input: Lord of the Rings
  - output:

- This helps the program know exactly what you're watching.
- Then, a subset of the cast will be printed out. An analysis has been run to determine which characters were important enough / relevant enough to be included, but here you have the opportunity to add or remove characters from this list.
- Now, depending on the number of images you've chosen to train on and the amount of characters in your movie, this can take a little while. For me, on an Intel Mac, it tends to take around 15 minutes. I recommend running this BEFORE you start watching, so that if you ever get stuck on a face, you can immediately get results!
- Next comes the image upload. Just enter the path to your image and run the function!
- Examples:

- The program even recognizes the actors in cast photos!
